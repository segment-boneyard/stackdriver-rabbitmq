stackdriver-rabbitmq
====================

A nodecron that checks on rabbitmq's status, and submits the stats to Stackdriver once a minute.

## Usage

``` shell
$ npm install -g stackdriver-rabbitmq
$ stackdriver-rabbitmq \
  --key [stackdriver-api-key] \
  --instance [instance-id] \
  --virtualHost [path]
```

You'll probably want to [run it in the background](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4018154/node-js-as-a-background-service/15616912#15616912).
